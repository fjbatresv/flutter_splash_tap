# Flutter Splash Tap

This is a little project making the weekly challenge with Fluttter.

This week the challenge was an animation on tap making a splash of a border that open and disappear progressively. The example for this challenge was taken from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qkhpeZdD7U) created by "Fun with Flutter".

You can check all the required code on [splash.dart](lib/splash.dart)
